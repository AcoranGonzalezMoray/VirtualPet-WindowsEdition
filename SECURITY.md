# 🔐 Security

I take the security of **VirtualPet** seriously, including the open source code repository associated with the project.

## 🛡️ Reporting a Vulnerability

<ins>**If you think you've found a security issue, please DO NOT report, discuss, or describe it on GitHub.**</ins>

**All security-related issues, concerns, and problems must be reported via email to: [acoranlol13@gmail.com].**

Please include all necessary information to reproduce the problem when sending the report, such as the steps to reproduce the issue. However, **do not include explicit details about the security issue in any repository contents.**

**_This is essential for the safety and integrity of VirtualPet._**

## 🚫 Embargo Policy

As the sole developer of **VirtualPet**, I will share security-related information only within the core development process on a need-to-know basis to address and fix the reported issue. This information will not be shared publicly or with any third parties unless explicitly approved in advance.

In case of accidental information disclosure, I must be promptly notified about what information was leaked, to whom, and the steps that will be taken to prevent any future leaks.

**⚠️ Repeated offenses may result in being blocked from contributing to the repository.**
