## 📦 Requirements

To run VirtualPet with its full range of features, including the AI model and other functionalities, the following hardware and software specifications are recommended:

### 🖥️ Hardware Requirements

- **RAM**: 16 GB or more (for optimal performance)
- **CPU**: Intel Core i5 or equivalent (minimum), with at least 4 cores and 8 threads. A higher-end processor such as an Intel Core i7 or i9, or an AMD Ryzen 7 or 9, is recommended for better performance, especially when running the AI model.
- **GPU**: A dedicated GPU with at least 8 GB of VRAM (e.g., NVIDIA GTX 1080, RTX 2060, or better). A GPU is required to run the AI model efficiently, particularly for tasks such as image generation and real-time AI processing.
- **Storage**: SSD with at least 20 GB of free space for optimal loading and storage of models and assets.
- **Network**: While the AI model runs locally, an internet connection may be required for some external features, such as browsing or accessing public anime content websites.

### 🖥️ Software Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 11 (with support for GPU acceleration).
- **.NET Framework**: .NET 8 or later (for full compatibility with the integrated features and the AI model).
- **CUDA** (for NVIDIA GPUs): Ensure that the latest CUDA version compatible with your GPU is installed for optimal performance with AI models.
- **Driver**: Latest GPU drivers installed (required for AI acceleration).
  
> [!TIP]
> For best performance, especially when using AI models, it is highly recommended to have a multi-core processor and a high-end GPU to handle complex calculations in real-time.
> A stable internet connection may be required for some features like anime content viewing and web browsing, but the AI model and most core functionalities are fully operational offline once set up.


## 📀 Installation

#### 👉Coming Soon...

## ⚙️ Configuration

VirtualPet relies on external services to provide some of its features, and to use them, you'll need to obtain API keys. The external services used by VirtualPet are as follows:

- **Prodia IA**: This AI service provides various functionalities within the app.
- **NewsAPI**: This API allows the app to fetch and display the latest news headlines.

### How to Add Your API Keys

Once you have obtained the necessary API keys for these services, you can add them to VirtualPet using one of the following methods:

#### A. Manual Configuration via `apiKeys.json`

1. Locate the `apiKeys.json` file in the `VirtualPet/Credentials/` directory. This file is where you will store your API keys.
2. Open the `apiKeys.json` file and enter your API keys in the following format:

```json
{
  "ApiKeys": [
    { "NEWSAPI": "YOUR_API_KEY" },
    { "PRODIA": "YOUR_API_KEY" }
  ]
}
```
#### B. Setting API Keys Through the Configuration Panel

Alternatively, when running VirtualPet, you can set your API keys directly from the **Configuration Panel** within the application:

1. Launch VirtualPet.
2. Open the **Configuration Panel** from the app's settings menu.
3. Enter your API keys for both Prodia IA and NewsAPI in the respective fields.
4. Save your changes.

This method allows you to update the API keys without needing to manually edit configuration files.


## 🤕 Known Issues

- In some screen resolutions, the panel does not adapt correctly, causing overflow of the tabs and their respective icons. This behavior results in incorrect display of the interface, negatively impacting the user experience, especially on screens with non-standard dimensions or smaller resolutions. (🐞)

## ⌨️ Setup

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
<details open>
  <summary>💻 VirutalPet</summary>
  
### Prerequisites

Before starting with the **VirtualPet** setup, ensure you meet the following preconditions:

1. **Bluetooth Enabled**: Enable Bluetooth on your device.
2. **Internet Connection**: An internet connection is required the first time you run the program to download the necessary components.
3. **Windows Transparency Mode**: This mode must be enabled. To configure it:
   - Go to `Settings` > `Accessibility` > `Visual Effects`.
   - Enable the **Transparency Effects** option.

---

### Project Setup

1. **Obtain the API Keys**:
   - Retrieve the API keys mentioned in the **Configuration** section.
2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Run the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-URL>
     ```
3. **Configure the API Keys**:
   - Set the API keys using the options provided in the project documentation.
4. **Open and Run the Project**:
   - Open Visual Studio as **Administrator**.
   - Run the **VirtualPet.Main** project with the `Debug - x64` profile.

> **Note:** The first time you run the project:
> - If the required model is not installed, a form will appear for installation.
> - For subsequent runs, if the model is already installed, the initial loading time will be shorter.

---

### Solution Structure

The solution consists of two main projects:

1. **VirtualPet.Main**:
   - Responsible for managing the forms and user interface-related classes.
2. **VirtualPet.Lib**:
   - Contains abstract classes reusable across the forms.

---
### `PathArchitecture` Class

The `PathArchitecture` class is responsible for managing all paths within the project, differentiating between:

- Operating systems: `x64` and `x86`.
- Execution modes: `Release` or `Debug`.

> **Important:** All project paths must be defined in this class. Avoid hardcoding paths directly in the code.

  <summary>📱 VirutalPet App</summary>

### Description

The **VirtualPet** app allows you to stream content from an Android device to **VirtualPet** (the purpose and functionality
of the app may change in the future)

---

### Setup

To configure the application, edit the `MainActivity` file with the following steps:

1. Locate and modify the line where the WebSocket server URI is set (Replace this IP address with the device running VirtualPet):
   
   ```kotlin
   val serverUri = URI("ws://IP:5700")
   ```
