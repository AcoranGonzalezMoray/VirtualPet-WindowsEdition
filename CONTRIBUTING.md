## 🛡️ Code of Conduct  

Although this is a personal project, I want to foster a respectful and collaborative environment. Please maintain a constructive and positive tone in all interactions. If you find something that could be improved, please present your ideas clearly and kindly. For more information, please visit this project's [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)  .


## 🚀 Getting Started  

Contributions are made via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). Here are some basic guidelines:  

- Before opening an Issue or PR, check if there’s already a related one. This helps keep the project organized.  
- Don’t hesitate to reach out if something is unclear; I’m happy to help you understand how the project works or how to contribute.  

### 🐞 Issues  

Issues are great for:  
- Reporting bugs.  
- Proposing new features or improvements.  
- Discussing ideas before implementing changes.  

When opening an Issue, please provide clear details:  
- What happens and how to reproduce the problem (if reporting a bug).  
- What you hope to achieve (if suggesting a new feature or improvement).  

If you find an existing Issue that matches your problem or proposal, comment on it instead of creating a new one.  

### 🔄 Pull Requests  

PRs are how you submit changes to the project. Please ensure:  
- Each PR focuses on a single improvement or fix.  
- The title and description of the PR are clear and follow the [Commit and PR Naming format](#commit-and-pull-request-naming).  
- You test your changes before submitting them.  

Steps to contribute:  
1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.  
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name following the [Commit and PR Naming format](#commit-and-pull-request-naming).  
3. Make your changes and commit them with clear messages following the [Commit and PR Naming format](#commit-and-pull-request-naming).  
4. Push your changes to your fork and open a PR in this repository.  

I will review PRs and provide feedback if needed.
